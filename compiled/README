This zip file contains the skeleton code required for HW3 in CMPS 405.
You should download this zip file into a Linux virtual machine and then
unzip it there.  

Compiling
=========
Use the terminal to change to the skeleton code directory, and run "make" 
in order to build the program.  This produces a binary named "parser" that 
you can run.  Consider this example:
cd hw3-skel
make
./parser

If you don't like the idea of using make, you can also manually compile
the code as follows:
gcc -o parser *.c
./parser

Where to Work
=============
You will need to make changes to both parser.c and get_commands.c in
order to complete this homework.  See the handout for more details about
what you are supposed to do.
